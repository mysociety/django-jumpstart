complete. Once done please delete this file.

  * step by step instructions on what to configure to get project started after copying
  * directory structure laid out correctly
  * README, INSTALL etc boilerplate files
  * settings.py ready for Django 1.3 logging etc
  * wsgi script for fastcgi to run
  * staging header in place
  * default base.html and main.scss
  * example entry for vhosts.pl with all exec scripts needed to deploy

Final touches:
